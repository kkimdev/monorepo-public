== CHROME WEB STORE LISTING ==

--- Description ---

Navigate any webpage with just your keyboard.

Keyboard Navigator overlays letter hints on every clickable element — links, buttons, inputs, and more. Press Shift to activate, type the letters, and you're there. No mouse needed.

How it works:
1. Press Left Shift to show hints on all interactive elements
2. Type the hint letters (e.g. "AB") to click that element
3. Hints auto-dismiss when done — your page stays clean

Features:
• Zero configuration — works instantly on every website
• New tab support — press Right Shift to open links in a new tab
• Smart targeting — hints appear on links, buttons, inputs, dropdowns, and contenteditable fields
• Scroll-aware — hints track elements as you scroll, even on sticky headers
• Lightweight — no background processes, no data collection, no permissions beyond the page you're on

Who is this for?
• Power users who want to browse faster
• Anyone with RSI or mobility limitations
• Developers who live in the keyboard
• Vim/Vimium users who want something simpler and more reliable

Open source. No tracking. No ads.

--- Single purpose description ---
Overlays keyboard hints on clickable elements so users can navigate and click without a mouse.

--- activeTab justification ---
activeTab is used to inject the content script that scans the current page for clickable elements and overlays keyboard hint labels on them. No data is read, stored, or transmitted.

--- scripting justification ---
scripting is used to inject CSS and JavaScript into the active tab to display keyboard navigation hints on interactive elements. The scripts run entirely locally and do not access, collect, or transmit any user data.

--- Host permission justification ---
Host permission (<all_urls>) is required so the content script can run on any webpage the user visits, enabling keyboard hint overlays on all sites. No data is collected, stored, or sent externally. The extension operates entirely client-side.
